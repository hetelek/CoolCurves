CoolCurves
==========

CoolCurves demonstrates how parametric Bézier curves are constructed. The slider is used to observe the curve and the position of the lines that are used to construct it. The Random button is used to discard the current lines and construct a new random curve. Inspired by Jason Davies's ["Animated Bèzier Curves"](http://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/). Developed by Stevie Hetelekides.

CoolCurves supports a (nearly) infinite amount of anchor lines, allowing for very complex and interesting curves. Rendering time will increase with more anchor lines.
