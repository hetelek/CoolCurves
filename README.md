CoolCurves
==========

CoolCurves demonstrates how parametric Bézier curves are constructed. The slider is used to observe the curve and the position of the lines that are used to construct it. The Random button is used to discard the current lines and construct a new random curve. Inspired by Jason Davies's ["Animated Bèzier Curves"](http://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/).

CoolCurves supports a (nearly) infinite amount of anchor points, allowing for very complex and intresting curves.
